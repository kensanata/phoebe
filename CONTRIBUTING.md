# Contributing to Phoebe

The simplest way to contribute is to improve the [Phoebe
wiki](https://transjovian.org:1965/phoebe). Many changes can simply be
added to the config file, and so many suggestions simply end up on the
[Configuration](https://transjovian.org:1965/phoebe/page/Configuration)
page.

If you have suggestions for the documentation of Phoebe itself, or
changes to the core, feel free to contact me by mail:
[alex@gnu.org](mailto:alex@gnu.org), or take a look at the
[alternatives](https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/Contact).

I prefer [patches via email](https://git-send-email.io/), but [GitHub
works as well](https://github.com/kensanata/phoebe).

As for issues, your options are:

* just send an email

* send a patch for the `TODO.md` file

* create a page on my [Software Wiki](https://alexschroeder.ch/software/Phoebe)

* create an issue [on GitHub](https://github.com/kensanata/phoebe/issues)
