=head1 App::Phoebe::DebugIpNumbers

By default the IP numbers of your visitors are not logged. This small extensions
allows you to log them anyway if you're trying to figure out whether a bot is
going crazy.

There is no configuration. Simply add it to your F<config> file:

    use App::Phoebe::DebugIpNumbers;

=cut

package App::Phoebe::DebugIpNumbers;
use App::Phoebe qw($log);
use Modern::Perl;

# We have to override the copy that was imported into the main namespace in the
# start_servers subroutine.
no warnings 'redefine';
*old_handle_request = \&main::handle_request;
*main::handle_request = \&handle_request;

sub handle_request {
  my ($stream) = @_;
  my $address = $stream->handle->peerhost;
  $log->debug("Visitor: $address");
  return old_handle_request(@_);
}
