# Phoebe Wiki

Phoebe does two and a half things:

It's a program that you run on a computer and other people connect to it using
their Gemini client in order to read the pages on it.

It's a wiki, which means that people can edit the pages without needing an
account. All they need is a client that speaks both Gemini and Titan, and the
password. The default password is "hello". ðŸ˜ƒ

Optionally, people can also access it using a regular web browser.

Gemini itself is very simple network protocol, like Gopher or Finger, but with
TLS. Gemtext is a very simple markup language, a bit like Markdown, but line
oriented. See ["GEMTEXT"](#gemtext).

To take a look for yourself, check out the test wiki via the web or via the web.

- [What is Gemini?](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/)
- [Gemini link collection](https://git.sr.ht/~kr1sp1n/awesome-gemini)
- [Test site, via the web](https://transjovian.org:1965/test)
- [Test site, via Gemini](gemini://transjovian.org/test)

## Reading the wiki

This repository comes with a Perl script called
[gemini](https://metacpan.org/pod/gemini) to download Gemini URLs.

Other clients can be found here:

- [Gemini software](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/software/)
- [Gemini clients](https://transjovian.org:1965/gemini/page/Clients)

See [App::Phoebe::Web](https://metacpan.org/pod/App%3A%3APhoebe%3A%3AWeb) to
enable reading via the web.

## Gemtext

Pages are written in gemtext, a lightweight hypertext format. You can use your
favourite text editor to write them.

A text line is a paragraph of text.

    This is a paragraph.
    This is another paragraph.

A link line starts with "=>", a space, a URL, optionally followed by whitespace
and some text; the URL can be absolute or relative.

    => http://transjovian.org/ The Transjovian Council on the web
    => Welcome                 Welcome to The Transjovian Council

A line starting with "\`\`\`" toggles preformatting on and off.

    Here is an example:
    ```
    The tapping calms me:
    Constant mindless murmuring
    Rain drops against glass
    ```

A line starting with "#", "##", or "###", followed by a space and some text is a
heading.

    ## License
    The GNU Affero General Public License.

A line starting with "\*", followed by a space and some text is a list item.

    * one item
    * another item

A line starting with ">", followed by a space and some text is a quote.

    The monologue at the end is fantastic, with the city lights and the rain.
    > I have seen things you people would not believe.

## Editing the wiki

How do you edit a Phoebe wiki? You need to use a Titan-enabled client.

[Titan](https://transjovian.org:1965/titan) is a companion protocol to Gemini:
it allows clients to upload files to Gemini sites, if servers allow this. On
Phoebe, you can edit "raw" pages. That is, at the bottom of a page you'll see a
link to the "raw" page. If you follow it, you'll see the page content as plain
text. You can submit a changed version of this text to the same URL using Titan.

Known clients:

This repository comes with a Perl script called
[titan](https://metacpan.org/pod/titan) to upload files.

[Gemini Write](https://alexschroeder.ch/cgit/gemini-write/) is an extension for
the Emacs Gopher and Gemini client [Elpher](https://thelambdalab.xyz/elpher/).

[Gemini & Titan for Bash](https://alexschroeder.ch/cgit/gemini-titan/about/) are
two shell functions that allow you to download and upload files.

[Lagrange](https://gmi.skyjake.fi/lagrange/) is a GUI client that is Titan
enabled.

See [App::Phoebe::WebEdit](https://metacpan.org/pod/App%3A%3APhoebe%3A%3AWebEdit) to
enable editing via the web.

## Installation

Using `cpan`:

    cpan App::Phoebe

Manual install:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make install

## Dependencies

If you are not using `cpan` or `cpanm` to install Phoebe, you'll need to install
the following dependencies:

- [Algorithm::Diff](https://metacpan.org/pod/Algorithm%3A%3ADiff), or `libalgorithm-diff-xs-perl`
- [File::ReadBackwards](https://metacpan.org/pod/File%3A%3AReadBackwards), or `libfile-readbackwards-perl`
- [File::Slurper](https://metacpan.org/pod/File%3A%3ASlurper), or `libfile-slurper-perl`
- [Mojolicious](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mojolicious), or `libmojolicious-perl`
- [IO::Socket::SSL](https://metacpan.org/pod/IO%3A%3ASocket%3A%3ASSL), or `libio-socket-ssl-perl`
- [Modern::Perl](https://metacpan.org/pod/Modern%3A%3APerl), or `libmodern-perl-perl`
- [URI::Escape](https://metacpan.org/pod/URI%3A%3AEscape), or `liburi-escape-xs-perl`
- [Net::IDN::Encode](https://metacpan.org/pod/Net%3A%3AIDN%3A%3AEncode), or `libnet-idn-encode-perl`
- [Encode::Locale](https://metacpan.org/pod/Encode%3A%3ALocale), or `libencode-locale-perl`

I'm going to be using `curl` and `openssl` in the Quickstart section of
`phoebe`, so you'll need those tools as well. And finally, when people download
their data, the code calls `tar` (available from packages with the same name on
Debian derived systems).

## Installing Perl

If you are on GNU/Linx or macOS, I recommend installing from
[Perlbrew](https://perlbrew.pl/). Each Perl installation comes with its own
library directories, so if you switch Perl version, you need to reinstall Phoebe
for that Perl version.
